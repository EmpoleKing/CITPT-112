            <h2>Building a Budget Deck</h2>
            <p>When building a budget deck, it's important to focus on the core strategy and find cost-effective alternatives to expensive cards. Look for cards that offer similar effects but at a lower price point. For example, instead of using a high-cost card like "Snapcaster Mage," you can use "Mission Briefing" which provides a similar effect at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, consider using common and uncommon cards that can be just as effective as rare and mythic rare cards in the right deck.</p>

            <h2>Maximizing Value from Your Collection</h2>
            <p>Another way to play on a budget is to maximize the value of your existing collection. Take the time to sort through your cards and identify those that can be used in multiple decks. This will help you get the most out of your investment and allow you to build a variety of decks without needing to purchase new cards constantly. Trading with other players is also a great way to acquire new cards without spending money. Look for local trading events or online trading communities to find opportunities to trade cards you don't need for ones that will enhance your deck.</p>
